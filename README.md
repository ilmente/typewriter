# typewriter (ilmente.com kirby cms theme)

My personal website [ilmente.com](http://ilmente.com) is based on Kirby CMS 
and **this is the minimal theme I'm using there**.

### Requirements
- `node.js` 6.0.0 or above
- Kirby CMS 2.3.0 or above

### Setup
Download this repo on your local machine.
Move this repo content into your Kirby site root.
Then:

``` bash
# install the dependencies
npm install

# build the theme in developmente mode
# watching for changes over the assets 
npm run dev 

# build the theme in production mode
# optimising and compressing the code
npm run prod 
```
